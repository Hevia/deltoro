All my life Iâ€™ve had a passion in reading and appreciating works of Fantasy, imagining every single detail scene-scene.   Today I try to combine all those influences and ideas into drawings that depict my own ideas, and not just through the Fantasy framework. With every artwork comes an unquenchable desire to make more and more. I am very thankful to have had such excellent teachers since dropping everything to start anew in San Diego, and I hope to take any opportunity to demonstrate it further. Thank you for taking a look at my Portfolio, and feel free to contact me below!
